                <h3>PREPARATION:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 320°F/160°C.</li>
                    <li>In a small pot over medium heat, whisk the milk, cream cheese, and butter until smooth. Remove from heat and cool.</li>
                    <li>In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks until smooth, then slowly drizzle in the cream mixture, stirring until evenly combined.</li>
                    <li>Sift in the flour and the cornstarch, whisking to make sure there are no lumps.</li>
                    <li>In another large bowl, beat the egg whites with a hand mixer until you see soft peaks when lifting the mixer up from the egg whites.</li>
                    <li>Gradually add the sugar while continuing to beat until you see hard peaks when lifting the mixer up.</li>
                    <li>Take about ¼ of the egg whites and fold them into the egg yolk mixture, then repeat with the remaining egg whites until the batter is evenly combined.</li>
                    <li>Place a 4-inch parchment paper strip around the edge of a 9×3-inch cake pan that is already lined with parchment at the bottom. If you are using a springform pan, make sure to wrap the bottom and sides completely in foil, twice, to prevent any leakage.</li>
                    <li>Pour the batter into the parchment-lined pan and shake to release any large air bubbles.</li>
                    <li>Place the filled pan into a larger baking pan or dish lined with 2 paper towels at the bottom. The paper towels ensure that the heat is distributed evenly along the bottom of the pan. Fill the larger pan about 1-inch with hot water.</li>
                    <li>Bake for 25 minutes, then reduce the heat to 280°F/135°C, and bake for another 55 minutes, until the cake has risen to almost double its height.</li>
                    <li>Remove from oven, and carefully, invert the cake onto your dominant hand and peel off the paper. Be extremely careful, the cake will be hot. You can also invert the cake onto a plate, but this will cause the cake to deflate more.</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle the top of the cake with powdered sugar, slice, and serve with strawberries while still warm!</li>
                    <li>Enjoy!</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>Mix together the egg yolks, sugar, milk, and pancake mix in a very large bowl until it is smooth with no large lumps.</li>
                    <li>In another large bowl, beat the egg whites with a hand mixer until stiff peaks form when lifted.</li>
                    <li>Carefully fold the egg whites into the pancake batter, until just incorporated, making sure not to deflate the batter.</li>
                    <li>Grease two 3.5-inch metal ring molds and set them in the middle of a pan over the lowest heat possible. Fill the molds about ¾ of the way full with the batter, then cover the pan and cook for about 10 minutes, until the center of the pancakes are slightly jiggly.</li>
                    <li>Release the pancakes from the bottom of the pan with a spatula, then carefully flip them over, making sure not to spill any batter inside.</li>
                    <li>Cover and cook for another 5 minutes, then serve with butter, syrup, and assorted berries!</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>300 milliliters heavy cream</li>
                    <li>200 milliliters milk</li>

                <h4>PREPARATION:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 150C˚/300˚F.</li>
                    <li>Put the cream, milk, and roasted tea in a small pot and heat over medium-high heat just until it comes to a gentle boil. Turn off the heat and set aside to infuse the tea.</li>
                    <li>Whisk the yolks and sugar until pale color. Pour about ⅓ of the milk mixture into the yolks over a sieve, to temper the eggs. Once it is well-mixed, pour rest of the milk mixture over the mesh sieve into the yolks.</li>
                    <li>In a deep baking pan, place 4 ramekins. Pour the egg mixture into the ramekins. Pour hot water into the pan to come roughly halfway up the sides of the ramekins.</li>
                    <li>Bake at 150C˚/300F for 50 minutes or until the crème brûlée is set, but still a little jiggly in the middle when you shake it gently.</li>
                    <li>Remove the ramekins from the roasting pan and allow to cool to room temperature. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, and up to 3 days.</li>
                    <li>When ready to serve, spread a tablespoon of sugar on top of each crème brûlée.</li>
                    <li>Using a torch, melt the sugar for a crispy top. If you don’t have a torch, you can heat a metal spoon on the stove top and brûlée with back of the heated spoon.</li>
                    <li>Enjoy!</li>
