    <p>Working out three days per week is by far the most popular way to workout. While each routine has stated workout days ofMonday, Wednesday and Friday, any other three nonconsecutive days each week can be used. You can just as easily train on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays if it would be better for you. Be sure to program at least one full rest day between training days. Be on the way to a better, buffer body. Be careful not to overtrain!</p>
