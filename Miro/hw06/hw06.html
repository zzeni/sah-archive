        <p>Between 1969 and 1974, and again between 1989 and 2002, Nissan produced a high performance version of its Skyline sedan called the Nissan Skyline GT-R. This car proved to be iconic for Nissan[6][7] and achieved much fame and success on both road and track. The Nissan GT-R, although no longer carrying the " Skyline " badge, has heritage in the Nissan Skyline GT-R, which was only available in the United States as a grey market car. Similar to the later generations of the Skyline GT-Rs, the Nissan GT-R is four-wheel drive with a twin-turbo 6 cylinder engine and has the signature four round tail lights. However, the GT-R is an entirely new model sharing little with its Skyline siblings and is a complete redesign from previous Skylines rather than an incremental evolution; the four-wheel-steering HICAS system has been removed and the former straight-6 RB26DETT engine has been replaced with a new V6 VR38DETT.[8] Because of the GT-R's heritage, the chassis code for the all-new version has been called CBA-R35,or 'R35' for short (where CBA is the prefix for emission standard), carrying on the naming trend from previous Skyline GT-R generations. The GT-R has also retained its Skyline predecessor's nickname Godzilla,[10] given to it by the Australian motoring publication Wheels in its July 1989 edition.

        <h4>Article 2</h4>

        <p>Nissan chief creative officer, Shir≈ç Nakamura, has likened the new GT-R to the giant robots of the Gundam series.[13] Nakamura stated: "The GT-R is unique because it is not simply a copy of a European-designed Sports car; it had to really reflect Japanese culture. " Nissan's American designers sculpted the rear three quarters of the vehicle, while their European designers sculpted the roofline.[13] Polyphony Digital, creators of the Gran Turismo series of motor racing video games, were themselves involved in the development of the GT-R, having been contracted to design the GT-R's multifunction display.
