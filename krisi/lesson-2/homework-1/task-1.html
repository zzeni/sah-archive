        <h2>The top 3 most popular websites in the world:</h2>

                <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank"><img src="images/google.png" alt="google picture" title="Google" width="200"></a>
                <p id="google">Google is an American multinational technology company specializing in Internet-related services and products. These include online advertising technologies, search, cloud computing, software, and hardware. Google's search engine is a powerful tool. Without search engines like Google, it would be practically impossible to find the information you need when you browse the Web. Like all search engines, Google uses a special algorithm to generate search results. While Google shares general facts about its algorithm, the specifics are a company secret. This helps Google remain competitive with other search engines on the Web and reduces the chance of someone finding out how to abuse the system.</p>

                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank"><img src="images/youtube.png" alt="youtube picture" title="Youtube" width="200"></a>
                <p id="youtube">Started in 2005 by Chad Hurley, Jawed Karim and Steve Chan, Youtube is currently world's most popular video sharing website. From video clips of cats fighting with dogs shot with cellphones to professionally produced movie trailers, the site hosts it all. According to Google, which bought the website in 2006, over 800 million users visit YouTube every month, over three billion hours of videos are watched every month and over 72 hours of video content is uploaded every minute. In the recent years, the website has tried to attract more professional video content producers. It has tied up with several Hollywood studios and gives people a share in the advertisement revenue if they sign up for the Youtube partner programme to produce exclusive content for the website. With its reach and popularity, it has also emerged as a repository of first-person account. For example in the case of 2011 tsunami in Japan, videos shot by amateur people appeared on Youtube minutes after the disaster. At the same time, its growing popularity has forced it to deal with several contentious issues like copyright infringement, which is considered to be rampant on the website as users often upload copied video content without any regard for the rights of original producers. </p>

                <a href="https://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank"><img src="images/Facebook-logo.png" alt="facebook picture" title="Facebook" width="200"></a>
                <p id="facebook">In 2004, Mark Zuckerberg, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes, three Harvard University students, launched a Web site designed to put students in touch with one another, share their photos and meet new people. They called it thefacebook.com, and before long the site became extremely popular on the Harvard campus. A month after the site launched, the creators expanded it to include students from Stanford, Columbia and Yale. By 2005, students in 800 college networks across the United States could join the network, and its membership grew to more than 5 million active users. In August of that year, the site's name changed to Facebook.Facebook was originally intended for college students, but today anyone can join the network. Although the site's scope has expanded to include more than just students, its purpose remains the same -- giving people a way to share information in an easy and entertaining way. Like MySpace, Facebook is a social networking site.</p>
