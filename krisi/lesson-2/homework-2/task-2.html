                <h2>What breed should I get?</h2>
                <p>Planning on getting a cat? That’s great! Your new cat will likely become a much-loved member of your household, enriching the lives of everyone in your family for many years to come. You can increase the odds of that happening by making careful choices in selecting the breed of your new cat. Cats are relatively long-lived animals. The kitten that you bring home today could easily be a member of your family for the next 15, even 20 years. So the choice of which cat to bring home is an important one. Get this decision right, and you’ll reap the rewards of a wonderful and fulfilling relationship that will bring years of joy to your household. But it’s not an easy decision. There are lots of variables to weigh, and lots of options to sort through. And perhaps the single most important decision you’ll make is in selecting the breed of cat you will buy.

                <h2>First day</h2>
                <p>
                    Now, you are ready for your cat’s homecoming. Preferably, bring her home in a cat carrier. It will feel safer to her. She has seen a lot of excitement, so take her directly to her new room. (Make sure the toilet lid is down, if she’s to acclimate in your bathroom.) Ideally, you would restrict her exposure to the whole family, but naturally, everyone is going to want to see her. Remind them of the ground rules you’ve set up. Sit on the floor and let her come to you. Don’t force her. Just let her get acquainted on her own time. If she doesn’t approach, leave her alone and try again later. Some cats are particularly frightened, and she may retreat to her hidey hole and not come out when you’re around at all. She may only come out at night when the house is quiet. Give her time. Your newly adopted cat may not eat much or at all at first. It’s best to give your cat the same food she had at the shelter or in her foster home, at least at first. Keeping some things familiar will make her feel more secure. Be sure to change her water frequently and make sure that she is drinking. If your cat hasn’t eaten for a few days, call your vet to ask for advice.</p>

                <h2>The following weeks</h2>
                <p>
                    It may take your cat a week or two to adjust. Be patient. Within a week of being adopted, take your newly adopted cat for her first wellness visit with a veterinarian. If you have a record of immunizations from the shelter, take it with you. As your cat adjusts, she’ll show signs that she wants to explore outside her safe haven. Make sure other pets or family members won’t startle her while she gradually expands her territory. She may be ready to play, so you can furnish some toys. Many cats like feather wands from the pet supply store, but homemade toys are often favored. A wad of a tissue paper to bat around or a paper bag to hide in can be fun.
