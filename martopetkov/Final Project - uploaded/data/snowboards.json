        "desc": "The Jones Flagship Snowboard has a well deserved reputation as the premier big mountain gun on the planet -- Jeremy rides it and keeps refining it as technology and his own riding evolve -- and the results are extraordinary. For 2017 Jones used the Spoon 3.0 shape with 7 mm of bevel in the tip and 7 mm of bevel in the tail, providing even greater flexibility in tight turns and on steep spine lines. For dampening, a new flax fiberglass weave was developed and Power V Basalt stringers were added for extra pop. When it's going off and you plan on going big, there's no substitute for the Flagship.",

The rapper that burst on the scene out of nowhere with the club banger, \"All Gold Everything?\" Well the Lib Tech Wittlake World's Greenest C3 BTX Snowboard is just like that song -- except all green. Every bit of this board that could hold a pigment gets the green treatment, and it ain't too bad on the environment, either. Soon you'll be on Instagram straight flexing -- the board that is. Rail in the pow, jib whatever you want, and focus on fun without harshing Mother Nature. Don't believe us just watch.",
