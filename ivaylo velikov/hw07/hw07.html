                    <p>"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"</p>

                    <h3>The Origins of Lorem Ipsum Text</h3>
                    <p>T"Lorem Ipsum" is the common name for dummy text often used in the design, printing, and typesetting industries. Designers discovered long ago that if you used real text with your design mockups, then clients would often get distracted by the meaning of the words; but if you use dummy text in a foreign language, such as Lorem Ipsum — which is excerpted from a play written in Latin by Cicero in 45 B.C. — then clients will ignore the text and focus instead on the design elements. Printers have been using Lorem Ipsum since at least the 1500s, and it has remain essentially unchanged into the electronic age. It was re-popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and made even more commonly available through modern desktop publishing software, which often includes Lorem Ipsum as default filler. Today Lorem Ipsum is commonly used in mockups for brochures, layouts, and preliminary website designs. Below is some sample Lorem Ipsum text you may easily copy & paste into your work.</p>

                    <h4>More information</h4>
                    <p>In publishing and graphic design, lorem ipsum (derived from Latin dolorem ipsum, translated as " pain itself ") is a filler text commonly used to demonstrate the graphic elements of a document or visual presentation. Replacing meaningful content with placeholder text allows designers to design the form of the content before the content itself has been produced.[citation needed] The lorem ipsum text is typically a scrambled section of De finibus bonorum et malorum, a 1st-century BC Latin text by Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed to make it nonsensical, improper Latin.[citation needed] A variation of the ordinary lorem ipsum text has been used in typesetting since the 1960s or earlier, when it was popularized by advertisements for Letraset transfer sheets. It was introduced to the Information Age in the mid-1980s by Aldus Corporation, which employed it in graphics and word-processing templates for its desktop publishing program PageMaker</p>
