1. Create a GitHub profile (or log-in into your existing one)

2. Go to https://github.com/zzeni/swift-academy-homeworks/ and fork it!

3. Open your freshly forked copy (the one in your profile) and then open the L2 folder.

5. You'll see an empty index.html and a style.css file.

6. Find how to edit them (it's GitHub built=in functionality) and paste the code from your files there.
If you need to upload an image and you can't figure out how to do it yourself, let me know and I'll help.

7. You can repeat the same actions with the L1 folder, and upload there your first homework.

8. Send me the link to your GitHub repo :)

9. Well done!! 

You have one beer from me if you manage to do it by Monday evening (19.10.2015) ;)
