        <h3>Sun: Our Star</h3>

        <p>The sun is a star, a hot ball of glowing gases at the heart of our solar system. Its influence extends far beyond            the orbits of distant Neptune and Pluto. Without the sun's intense energy and heat, there would be no life on                Earth. And though it is special to us, there are billions of stars like our sun scattered across the Milky Way                galaxy.</p>
        <h3>Mercury: The Swiftest Planet</h3>

        <p>Mercury's eccentric orbit takes the small planet as close as 47 million km (29 million miles) and as far as 70                million km (43 million miles) from the sun. If one could stand on the scorching surface of Mercury when it is at              its closest point to the sun, the sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from                Earth.</p>
        <h3>Venus: Planetary Hot Spot</h3>

        <p>Similar in structure and size to Earth, Venus' thick, toxic atmosphere traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect.            A permanent layer of clouds traps heat, creating surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead. Glimpses below the            clouds reveal volcanoes and deformed mountains. Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction of most planets.</p>
        <h3>Earth: Our Home Planet</h3>

        <p>Earth, our home planet, is the only planet in our solar system known to harbor life - life that is incredibly                diverse. All the things we need to survive exist under a thin layer of atmosphere that separates us from the cold,            airless void of space.</p>
        <h3>Mars: The Red Planet</h3>
        <img src="http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02445/mars_2445397b.jpg">
        <p>Mars is a cold desert world. It is half the diameter of Earth and has the same amount of dry land. Like Earth,                Mars has seasons, polar ice caps, volcanoes, canyons and weather, but its atmosphere is too thin for liquid water            to exist for long on the surface. There are signs of ancient floods on Mars, but evidence for water now exists                mainly in icy soil and thin clouds.</p>
